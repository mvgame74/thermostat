# Thermostat: DOM

[Back to the Challenge Map](README.md)

Now, you are at the point which excites a lot of people, and is also JavaScript's unique superpower - dynamically changing content on a webpage. Using the browser DOM API, we can grab any element on the page, change its HTML and CSS, delete it, move it elsewhere, draw on the page, and many other fantastic things. Seeing as so far all user interaction you've done so far has been through the medium of forms and links, this will hopefully excite you.

In this challenge, you will manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript.

### Challenge setup

The first part of this challenge is intentionally left really open. When you first use the DOM functions, you should play with it, mainly because changing things on the page is still going to be fun. Make the background of the page silly colours. Go and change other pages on the web using the browser console. Insert rude words. Delete banners. Replace all the pictures on the page with Nikesh.

### Learning Objectives covered

- Explain some benefits of using the DOM API
- Explain why we need to use `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', ...)`
- Use the DOM API to build interactive functionality into a webpage
- Understand some things about how the DOM uses the technique of callbacks with event listeners

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:
- [ ] Play with the DOM
- [ ] Play with the DOM a bit more
- [ ] Create another file that will hold your JavaScript code that manages the interface between the UI and the thermostat object.  Load the file into your HTML page.
- [ ] Hook up your buttons/links so they run the methods on the underlying thermostat model
