# Thermostat: APIs

[Back to the Challenge Map](README.md)

Wouldn't it be good if before setting your thermometer's temperature, you knew what the weather was like outside and then you could set the thermometer's interface appropriately?

Add a feature to display the weather in a city selected by the user.

### Learning Objectives covered

- [ ] Define 'AJAX' as 'Asynchronous JavaScript And XML'
- [ ] Explain that AJAX allows users to interact asynchronously with other web entities (such as servers) without page reloads
- [ ] Use AJAX to retrieve data from an API

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Use the Fetch API to get the weather information for London from a weather API. Display the weather information to the user.
- [ ] Add further functionality so that the user can select their current city and the weather provided is for the selected city.
